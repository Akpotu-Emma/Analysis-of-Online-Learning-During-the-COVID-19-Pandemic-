# Analysis-of-Online-Learning-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-
This dataset, encompassing web behavior related to online learning from 2004 to 2021, captures the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning as schools worldwide transitioned to remote education, focusing on the 20 countries most affected by the outbreak.

The dataset encompasses monthly web behavior data regarding online learning, covering a timeline from January 2004 to December 2021. It provides insights into the 
online engagement of students in different countries during the pandemic. The selected countries for this analysis include Spain, Turkey, and Ukraine chosen for their 
distinct online learning experiences during this period. The dataset was cleaned using python to load the dataset using pandas, display the columns, pre-process the dataset and check empty spaces.A new column was created (Year) to classify the data and to summarize the data. It was extracted from the existing "Month" column, facilitating a clearer year-wise analysis of the online learning metric. A visualization line chart from plotly library was created to show the values on the chart. Identified the year with the highest and lowest 
engagement data for each country. The data was then summarized by year, allowing for the identification of trends and patterns over time.
### INSIGHTS
Spain: The analysis highlighted Spain as the country with the highest online learning metrics. Spain demonstrated a steady growth pattern, with a peak in 2020 with a 
total engagement of 546, likely influenced by the global shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Turkey: Turkey emerged with the second highest online learning metrics. Turkey demonstrated with a total engagement of 382 in 2004, which suggests a strong foundation for online learning, prior to the fluctuations observed during the pandemic.

Ukraine: The analysis showed that Ukraine faced significant challenges, which led to a total engagement of 110 in 2009 and a decline of 0 in 2004,2005 and 2006 resulting in the lowest online learning metrics among the countries analyzed.
### RECOMMENDATION
Based on the analysis, it is recommended that educational institutions and policymakers continue to develop and support online learning infrastructure, even as schools reopen. Countries that experienced substantial growth in online learning should consider investments in digital literacy, technology, and internet accessibility to maintain the momentum of online education. Additionally, identifying periods of low activity can help in planning resources and engagement strategies to ensure continuity and inclusivity in education.
